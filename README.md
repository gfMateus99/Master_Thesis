# Master Thesis Repository

**Repository with the code for the thesis:** 
- Data and computer center prediction of usage and cost: An interpretable machine learning approach.

**Thesis objective:** 
- Master thesis developed in collaboration with Novobanco. The objective is to use interpretable machine learning models to predict computational usage of the novobanco data center. In addition, we will develop a novel method using NLP techniques to explore the impact of human context on novobanco data center usage.
