# Master Thesis Repository
Repository with the code that was developed in the scope of my master thesis.
 
#### Objective of this thesis: 
The objective is to use interpretable machine learning models to predict computational usage of the novobanco data center. In addition, we will develop a novel method using NLP techniques to explore the impact of human context on novobanco data center usage. 
 
## Organization of the repository
